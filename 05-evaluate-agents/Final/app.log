2024-09-12 15:10:19,029 - INFO - advice: The translation provided has a potential ambiguity in the translation of the positive button text. "Guardar" typically translates to "Save" in the context of saving files or data, not necessarily living beings like a puppy. A more appropriate translation in this context would be "Salvar," which conveys the act of rescuing or saving a life. Therefore, I would recommend revising the positive button text to ensure it accurately reflects the intended action.
