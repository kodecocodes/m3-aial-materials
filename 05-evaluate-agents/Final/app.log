# A message in the dialog box asking the user if they want to save the puppy.
message: ¿Te gustaría salvar al cachorro?

# Text on a button in the dialog box that the user can click to discard the puppy.

2024-09-12 19:53:16,432 - INFO - advice: The translation for the "positive_button" seems to be problematic. While "Guardar" can mean "Save" in many contexts, it is more commonly understood as "store" or "keep". In the context of saving a puppy, "Salvar" would be a more appropriate and unambiguous translation. Therefore, I recommend changing "Guardar" to "Salvar" for better clarity and accuracy.
